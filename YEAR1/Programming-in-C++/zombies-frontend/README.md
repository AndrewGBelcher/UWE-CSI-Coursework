# Zombies Web Client

This repo is a web (html 5, js, css) implementation of OOSD1 Zombies Client.

The site is written using Angular 2, and below are details on how to
work with it for development. It uses the
[angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), and this needs to be
installed before development.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in
the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via
[Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help
