  Welcome to OOSD1's game of Zombies!
</p>
<p>
  Your task is to save the world, OK maybe not the world, let's just
  say UWE from destruction from the funny living dead people. To acheive this
  you will need to provide an implementation of the Zombie Server, written in
  Java with the support libaries provided. See assignment (on Blackboard)
  specification for details.

<p>
  Once you have a Zombie Server ready for testing, start it running, waiting
  for a WebSocket connection, and enter the URL and port below, then press
  connect. Good luck...
